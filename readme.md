A GitHub action attempts to source and update the contained dataset each night. 

# Development


## Codespaces

This repo can be opened through the Codespaces web interface (which has an option to connect with a local VS Code or through the browser).

A Codespace can also be created using the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli), and opened in local VS Code that way.

The GitHub CLI tool can also be used to [SSH into a codespaces session](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-codespaces-with-github-cli#ssh-into-a-codespace). 

## Local Docker

If cloned locally, this repo can be opened in VS Code (with the Remote-Containers extension it will prompt once open to re-open in the container).

Alternatively, `docker-compose run app bash` will give you a prompt that can run the dataset tool.
